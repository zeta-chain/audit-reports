# ZetaChain Audit Reports 

This folder serves as a comprehensive repository of all the public ZetaChain audit reports. We believe in transparency and accountability, which is why we make these reports readily available to our community, stakeholders, and the general public. By providing access to these audits, we aim to demonstrate our commitment to security and show how seriously we take your trust in the protocol.

We work diligently to address and resolve bugs as quickly as possible when they are discovered. Our team prioritizes critical vulnerabilities, ensuring they are fixed promptly to maintain the integrity and security of our system. For less urgent issues, we may take additional time to thoroughly analyze and implement the most effective solutions. This approach allows us to balance immediate security needs with thoughtful, long-term improvements to our codebase. We continuously monitor, assess, and enhance our security measures to provide a robust and trustworthy platform for our users.
